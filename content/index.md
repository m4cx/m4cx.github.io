# Welcome to m4cx.github.io

This site collects my work across projects, writing, and talks.

## What you will find

- Project overviews: open source, experiments, and live products.
- Blog posts on software development, software architecture, .NET, web, and AI.
- Talks, slide decks, videos, demos, and other recorded sessions.
- Small labs and code snippets that accompany articles or presentations.

## Quick navigation

- Projects: current focus areas and links to repositories or live demos.
- Blog: fresh posts plus archived articles for deep dives.
- Talks & media: slides, videos, and references to conference or meetup sessions.

## Why this exists

I wanted a single place to share learnings, experiments, and materials without friction. Expect concise write-ups, links to supporting code, and updates as new talks or projects go live.
